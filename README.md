# ChuniDB
Project for cataloging game data from Chunithm into relational databases since the data is scattered among thousands of loose XML files
Also used for automation of importing of translations into the same XML files.

## Compatibility and Scope
* Up to version 2.05 (Chunithm New Plus)
* Currently only supports music.xml files
* Omnimixes will be supported.
* Fan made mods are not supported unless there is sufficient proof that content originates from original game assets and share the same ID/schema set in said original assets.
